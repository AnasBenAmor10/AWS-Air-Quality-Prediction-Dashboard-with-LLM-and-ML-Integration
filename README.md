    aws_region = "your-region-here"
    aws_access_key_id="aws-access-id"
    aws_secret_access_key="your-secret-access-keye-here"

        KINESIS_STREAM_NAME = "airpollution_data"

        kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis',
            region_name=aws_region,
            aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
            aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
            aws_session_token=aws_session_token)
        ```
    ````

##### Note:

- It is necessary to have an S3 bucket named `useful-data-bucket` that containes the csv file `countries.csv`.

---

#### 🔗 Step 2: Configure Kinesis Data Streams

1. Navigate to the **Kinesis** section in AWS Console and Click on **Create stream**.
2. Name your stream (e.g., `airpollution_data`), and define the number of shards based on your data volume or choose the `On-Demand` option.
3. Once the stream is created, ensure the EC2 instance has the proper IAM role to send data to Kinesis.

---

#### ⚡ Step 3: Lambda Function Setup

1. Go to **AWS Lambda** and create a new function.
2. Select **Author from scratch** and use an the python runtime.
3. Set permissions for Lambda to read from Kinesis and write to S3.

  <img alt="Data Visualisation" src="Images/lambda-light.png" >
</picture>

---

#### 🗂️ Step 4: Store Data in S3

1. Create an S3 bucket:
   - Go to **S3** in AWS Console and click **Create Bucket** and specify a unique name (e.g. `airquality-databucket`).
   - Set permissions and configure the bucket to store the processed weather data.
   - The data is stored in folders, each folder designating a specific country and its corresponding data.
2. Ensure that the Lambda function has the appropriate IAM role to write data to S3.

---

#### Step 5: Set up AWS Glue Crawlers and Tables

1. Go to AWS Glue Databases and create a new Database with a unique name (e.g., `airquality_base`).
2. Go to AWS Glue and create a new Crawler.
3. Define the source as the S3 bucket where weather data is stored.
4. Set the `airquality_base` database as the output.
5. Set up the crawler to run on a scheduled basis (e.g., every hour) to keep the Glue Catalog up-to-date.
6. After running the whole pipeline, navigate to the AWS Glue Table schema and make sure it is identical to `data_schema.json` or update it.

#### 📈 Step 7: Visualize with Grafana

##### Install Grafana

To visualize the air pollution data, we installed Grafana on an `t2.medium` EC2 instance

##### Grafana Installation

1. Download and run Grafana:
   - Create an t2.medium EC2 Instance and update the inbound rules on port 3000
   - Open the Instance terminal and install Grafana
     ```bash
     sudo yum update -y
     sudo yum install grafana -y
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     ```
2. Create the file `credentials`in the folder path `usr/share/grafana/.aws` and store your AWS credentials inside. - These tokens are available in your AWS console under:
   AWS Management Console → AWS Details section when you sign in to your AWS interface.
3. Launch and enable Grafana:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start grafana-server
   sudo systemctl enable grafana-server.service
   ```
4. Once Grafana is running, access it at `http://<instance-address>:3000`. The default credentials are:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
5. After logging in, change the password for security purposes.

##### Add Athena as a Data Source

1. In Grafana, go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** > **Add Data Source**.
2. Select **Athena** from the list of available data sources.
3. Enter the connection details:
   - **Name**: A name for the data source (e.g., `Athena Air Pollution Data`).
   - Use the `Credentials file` as the Authentication provider and select the region where your Athena queries will run.
   - **Athena Workgroup**: Specify the workgroup you are using (or leave default).
   - Select the **Database** and the **Table** you are qureing as well as the S bucket for query results' storage.

##### Create a Dashboard in Grafana

1. After configuring the Athena data source, create a new dashboard in Grafana.
2. Add panels for visualizing weather data.
3. Configure queries for each panel.

   If you want to implement my dashboard directly, take the data_schema.json file from the Grafana folder in my repository and add it to your settings for quick deployment. 📂⚙️

### ⚙️ Model Training

To predict air quality indices (AQI) based on weather data, we have developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras. The approach focuses on capturing relationships between weather factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and air pollution metrics (e.g., NO2, PM2.5, SO2) to estimate AQI levels.

#### 🚀 Approach

1. **Model Architecture**

   - Designed to capture complex relationships between weather conditions and air quality metrics.
   - Utilizes layers such as dense, convolutional, and recurrent networks based on the data characteristics.

2. **Training Strategy**
   - **EarlyStopping**: Helps prevent overfitting by halting training once validation performance stagnates.
   - **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the best-performing model during training, ensuring the optimal model is retained.
   - **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Dynamically adjusts the learning rate to help the model converge more effectively.

#### 🔧 Model Configuration

- **Training Parameters**:

  - Epochs: 100
  - Batch Size: 16
  - Validation Split: `X_val`, `y_val`

- **Callbacks**:
  - **EarlyStopping**: Monitors `val_accuracy` and stops training when performance stops improving (patience=20, min_delta=0.0001).
  - **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the best model `best.keras` based on `val_accuracy`.
  - **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Adjusts the learning rate to `0.000001` when performance stagnates (factor=0.4, patience=5).

This training strategy ensures robust model learning and optimal performance for AQI prediction from weather data.

1. **Prepare the LLM Environment**:
   - Install the required Python libraries such as `transformers`, `flask` and `logging` (optional):
     ```bash
     pip install transformers flask logging
     ```
2. **Create a Script for LLM Integration**:

   - Write a Python script to query the LLM for analyzing the predicted values of pollutants and AQI: `llm.py`

3. **Integrate LLM Output into Grafana**:
   - Use Grafana's **Table Pannel** to display LLM-generated report.

#### 🌐 Step 3: Setup ngrok

1. **Install ngrok**:

   - Download and install ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).
   - Authenticate using your ngrok account:
     ```bash
     ngrok authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>
     ```

2. **Expose Local Services**:

   - Use ngrok to expose your local API Gateway or LLM services:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 5000
     ```

3. **Update API Endpoints**:
   - Copy the generated ngrok URL and use it in your Grafana data source to access the LLM service remotely.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     Forwarding    https://<unique-id>.ngrok.io -> localhost:5000
     ```
